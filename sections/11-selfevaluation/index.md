# Self-evaluation

## **Role in the Project**

I was responsible for the full end-to-end implementation of the Energy Analytics Dashboard.
My role covered:

* Data ingestion pipeline: ENTSO-E API integration, data cleaning, timezone handling, and cross-border flow extraction.
* Database layer: PostgreSQL schema design and efficient upsert logic.
* Dashboard development: interactive visualization using Dash, KPIs, charts, and tables.
* CI/CD automation: GitHub Actions setup, testing workflow, static checks, semantic versioning, and release automation.
* Project structure & packaging: Poetry configuration, environment management, and repository organization.
* Documentation: full README, User Guide, Developer Guide, and final Report content.

I also managed the debugging, refactoring, and quality improvements across all modules.


## **Strengths**

* **Strong ownership of the entire pipeline**: I designed and implemented all ETL steps, dashboard UI, and database interactions.
* **Robust CI/CD integration**: Setup of automated linting, mypy, tests, and semantic-release.
* **High code quality**: Clean modular structure, logging, typing, and maintainable design.
* **Effective debugging & problem-solving**: Fixed several API, timezone, and deployment issues, and improved reliability.
* **Clear documentation**: Produced complete user, developer, and system documentation.
* **Adaptability**: Adjusted project structure to align with the professor’s template while maintaining functionality.


## **Weaknesses**

* **Initial project structure mistakes** (e.g., wrong package naming) required later corrections.
* **Spent too much time refactoring** instead of focusing earlier on documentation.
* **Sometimes implemented features before fully planning them**, which caused additional rework.
* **Limited test coverage**: Only basic smoke tests implemented; more unit tests could be added.
* **Dashboard design iterations** took longer than expected because of UX decisions and API data inconsistencies.


## **Overall Assessment**

I believe my contribution to the project was substantial and covered the most complex and technical components.
The project reached a professional and stable state thanks to careful iteration, debugging, and alignment with the required template.
Although some inefficiencies occurred during development, I improved rapidly, and the final outcome demonstrates a strong understanding of software engineering principles, CI/CD practices, and data pipeline design.
