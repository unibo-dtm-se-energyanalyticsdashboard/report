## Abstract
The Energy Data Analytics System (EDAS) is a software solution designed to ingest, store, process, and visualize energy data provided by the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform.  
Its primary purpose is to support exploratory data analysis, allowing users to examine electricity consumption, production, and cross-border flows across European countries.

The system features:
- an automated ingestion pipeline that retrieves updated time-series from ENTSO-E,
- a PostgreSQL database to store normalized historical datasets,
- a dashboard interface for querying aggregated indicators,
- a modular architecture supporting extension and additional analytics.

The project emphasizes clean software engineering principles, including modular design, static analysis (mypy), automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, secure configuration through environment variables, and reproducible deployment.
